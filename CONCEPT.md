# Theme: Every 10 seconds

## Plot

You are stranded on a deserted island with two teammates. You see nothing but water and sand. But there, far in the distance you see three figures, which slowly move towards you. Quickly! You have to think of a plan to escape from the imminent danger. You agree with your two fellow islanders to somehow get the three figures off the island. You further notice that the figures are moving at 10 second intervals - this is your opportunity! Good luck!

## Concept

The game is played with two players. The goal is to push the figures (for example 3) of the other player off a platform. Each player has 10 seconds to plan the moves of his three pieces, which are completed after this interval.

Either the whole thing is implemented with physical properties, so that you have to specify the direction and strength of each push, or (and possibly easier) with a given grid (hexagon or similar), where you specify the direction and number of grid moves.
